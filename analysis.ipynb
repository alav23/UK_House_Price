    "\n",
    "This project analyses the evolution of the London housing market over the last three decades using official UK House Price Index (HPI) data (https://data.london.gov.uk/dataset/uk-house-price-index-2zwx6/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to:\n",
    "- Understand long-term price trends across London and the UK\n",
    "- Compare property types and regional performance\n",
    "- Evaluate the relationship between transaction volume and property prices\n",
    "- Identify boroughs with the highest long-term price appreciation\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis is designed to demonstrate **practical data analysis skills** using Python, beyond theoretical coursework.\n"

    "## Data Sources\n",

    "The dataset is provided by the UK House Price Index (HPI) and contains multiple Excel sheets:\n",

    "- **By type**:  \n",
    "  Monthly average prices and price indices by property type (Detached, Flat, etc.) for London and the UK.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Average price**:  \n",
    "  Monthly average property prices for each London borough.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sales Volume**:  \n",
    "  Monthly transaction volumes for each London borough.\n",

    "## Data Cleaning & Preparation Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "Before analysis, the data undergoes a structured cleaning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Column names are standardised to remove whitespace inconsistencies.\n",
    "2. Dates are normalised:\n",
    "   - The **By type** sheet requires combining Year and Month into a datetime object.\n",
    "   - Other sheets already contain a Date column but require parsing and validation.\n",
    "3. Non-numeric values (e.g. codes, placeholders) are coerced into NaN and removed.\n",
    "4. Data is reshaped from wide to long format to enable flexible grouping and merging.\n",
    "5. Only valid observations with complete price and volume information are retained.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures consistency, reproducibility, and analytical reliability.\n"
